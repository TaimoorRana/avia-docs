We wrote this document so that you have a better idea of how we decide what AviaCommerce does and what AviaCommerce doesn't do, and what our development philosophy is like. While we are excited to see community contributions, we are not likely to choose a path that violates one or more of these principles.

>**Note:**
>
>This document assumes a strong understanding of AviaCommerce. It describes the design principles of *AviaCommerce itself*.
