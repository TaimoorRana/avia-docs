We wrote this document so that you have a better idea of how we decide what Snitch does and what Snitch doesn't do, and what our development philosophy is like. While we are excited to see community contributions, we are not likely to choose a path that violates one or more of these principles.

>**Note:**
>
>This document assumes a strong understanding of Snitch. It describes the design principles of *Snitch itself*.
