This document explains all the decisions and considerations while designing AviaCommerce API's.

At present, avia has api's which can be consumed to plug into any front-end application. These api's can also be used as a base for writing custom controllers from scratch without using these API's.

API follow [json-api](http://jsonapi.org/) spec. 

At the momemt there is just support for store-front endpoints and actions. We'll be supporting endpoints for admin app at a later stage.
