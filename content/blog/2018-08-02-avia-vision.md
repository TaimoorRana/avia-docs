This article highlights the long term vision for aviacommerce.

**Simplify e-commerce ecosystem by unifying and creating smart services and providing consistent and cost effective solution to sellers.**

Today there are many e-commerce suits out there but there is no single solution where clients can find everything(at least the important ones) in one place to power a full e-commerce system. Stores usually have to use a plethora of services(warehousing, shipping, sms, email as plugins or sass). These services individually charge a lot of money. Today, the total costs at which any above SME e-commerce system operates is enormous(at least from our standards). For eg. A smart CRM platform today charges close to $3000-5000/month to provide advanced customer segmentation and targeting solutions for a million customers.

This system of e-commerce platform and connected external services needs disruption. It can be brought under one umbrella to provide a consistent experience and **huge** reduction in cost. Our initial research shows this huge cost can be brought down by a factor of 5-6X in short term and by 10X in long term.

Services that integrate with e-commerce systems do so with the help of plugins. These plugins require stores to have their own accounts/subscriptions with services such as Mailchimp, Sendgrid, ShipperHQ, ShipStation, Twillio etc. Some of these services work as standalone whereas others work as generic services. 

It's important to understand these 2 kinds of services to fully understand our idea of cost reduction.

**Standalone Services:** Sellers use these services independently which means sellers interact with these systems day in day out. Hence, it is not possible for aviacommerce to use one account for all sellers. Reason for this is configurations for these accounts are seller specific. eg. Shipstation, ShipperHQ, Custora, Blueshift, DOMO.

**Generic Services:** These services are generic purpose services such as _delivery network[1]_, email, sms etc to name a few. It's possible for aviacommerce to use one account for all sellers. Aviacommerce will have a contract agreement with these services and would be able to bargain on high volumes for better rates. These better rates are going to help in cost reduction and provide value to the seller.

It is important to note that third party apps/plugins canâ€™t be fully replaced. This is **NOT** what we want to achieve. It would be practically foolish/impossible to provide all the services out there which can be provided by the complete gamut of plugins from the third party services. Actually, that's the real power of having an extensions model. It provides for more choices driving competition which results in better services to the customers. Only those services that cost most should be targeted. There are few important plugins/services which fit under this category. Shipping, email, SMS, delivery networks, CRM/recommendation and targeting platforms cost most of the big chunk.

Today, It takes around $12k-15k/month to run any _decent[2]_ e-commerce system. This cost goes up as the volume increases. We believe there is a clear opportunity to bring down this cost and our efforts are inline with this belief.

So the plan is simple:
1. Create an open-source solution for e-commerce, get traction. Offer hosted services and support on top of it.
2. Provide solutions for the costly third party services, reduce cost by 5-6X.
3. Add more services, reduce the cost by a factor of 10X with volume.

That's about it for now. Sweet and Simple!
